#summary The background and history of the Django Queue Service project.

= History =

At OSCON 2007, I was hunting around for something to use to deal with background processing initiated from my web application. Not finding anything that I could immediately use and implement, I took it as a challenge to knock out something in the time I was there. The result is the django queue service.

The source also includes a file from the [http://www.cherrypy.org/ CherryPy] project - the [http://www.cherrypy.org/browser/tags/cherrypy-3.0.1/cherrypy/wsgiserver/__init__.py WSGIServer from CherryPy 3.0.1]. [http://www.compoundthinking.com/blog/ Mark Ramm] (from the TurboGears project) had suggested in his OSCON presentation that CherryPy had a nice WSGI Server, and after chatting with him I was curious if I could hook up a Django project into it. This project, being conceived there, was handy...

[http://bradfitz.com/ Brad Fitzpatrick] pointed me towards a project called [http://code.sixapart.com/svn/TheSchwartz TheSchwartz] (which also had a presentation at OSCON 2007, but I didn't make it to that session), but I'd found out about it after I had already written the code and nailed down the basic functionality.
