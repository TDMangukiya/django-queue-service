Documentation of our future plans, thoughts, and ideas for the service.

## Future Goals ##

  * Scalability improvements to handle huge number of queues, and
messages per queue
  * Distributed queues (may be just memcache-type distributability)

Some more ideas:
  * Authentication + Authorization (this doesn't exactly belong in there, but worth thinking about how the queue app can be used with some kind of auth and permissions)
  * A sample web app to serve as a usecase (perhaps web-based lightweight IM?)
  * Make URLs compatible with Amazon SQS ;)
  * Message priorities or out-of-band messages
